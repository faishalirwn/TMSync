## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

TMSync is a multi-service browser extension for anime/movie tracking across Trakt, AniList, and MAL with a **per-service independence** architecture.

### Core Philosophy
- **Service Independence**: Each service operates independently with no unified state
- **Transparency**: Users see exactly what each service has and what will happen
- **Simplicity**: No over-engineering - only what's needed

### Key Features
- **Scrobbling**: Universal logic applied per-service 
- **Ratings**: 0.1 step precision input with accurate service conversion
- **Comments**: Service-specific tabs plus write-to-all functionality
- **UI**: Global scrobbling toggle and minimal service transparency

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

- **7 Active Requirements** (all approved)
- **7 Implementation Tasks** (ready to start)
- **5 Architecture Decisions** (all accepted)

## ðŸš€ Ready for Implementation

The project has complete requirements, tasks, and architectural decisions. Start with:
- TASK-0013-00-00: Enhanced service independence architecture (foundation)
- Or TASK-0014-00-00: Global scrobbling toggle (quick win)
