# TMSync Current Development State

## Architecture Status
- **Multi-service foundation**: âœ… Complete
- **Active services**: Trakt.tv (primary), AniList (secondary)
- **Interface compliance**: Both services implement TrackerService interface
- **Type system**: Service-agnostic types implemented across codebase

## Last Major Work
**Current**: Implementing unified service authentication system
- âœ… Created generic `useServiceAuth` hook for any TrackerService
- âœ… Built `useMultiServiceAuth` hook for managing all services
- âœ… Created `AuthenticationHub` component with unified UI
- âœ… Updated options page to use new authentication system
- âœ… Added AniList client ID (27973) to AniListService
- ðŸ”„ Ready to test AniList OAuth flow

**Previous**: `54d243d` - Complete multi-service architecture with TrackerService interface compliance

## Development Environment
- **Package manager**: pnpm
- **Testing**: `npm run check-all` for full validation
- **Multi-service test**: `npx tsx src/test-services.ts`
- **Services registered**: 2 services (Trakt priority 1, AniList priority 2)

## Ready for Next Work
The codebase is in a clean, stable state ready for Phase 3 UI/UX multi-service integration work. 

**TODO System**: Now uses problem-solving format to encourage creative solutions rather than task execution. See TODO.md for current problems to solve with success criteria and alternative approaches.
