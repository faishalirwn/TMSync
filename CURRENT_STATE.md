# TMSync Current Development State

## Architecture Status
- **Multi-service foundation**: âœ… Complete
- **Active services**: Trakt.tv (primary), AniList (secondary)
- **Interface compliance**: Both services implement TrackerService interface
- **Type system**: Service-agnostic types implemented across codebase

## Last Major Work
**Commit**: `54d243d` - Complete multi-service architecture with TrackerService interface compliance
- Made TraktService fully compatible with TrackerService interface
- Updated all handlers/components to use service-agnostic types
- Registered both services in ServiceRegistry with proper priorities
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors

## Development Environment
- **Package manager**: pnpm
- **Testing**: `npm run check-all` for full validation
- **Multi-service test**: `npx tsx src/test-services.ts`
- **Services registered**: 2 services (Trakt priority 1, AniList priority 2)

## Ready for Next Work
The codebase is in a clean, stable state ready for Phase 3 UI/UX multi-service integration work.
