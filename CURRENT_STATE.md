# TMSync Current Development State

## Architecture Status
- **Multi-service foundation**: ✅ Complete
- **Active services**: Trakt.tv (primary), AniList (secondary)
- **Interface compliance**: Both services implement TrackerService interface
- **Type system**: Service-agnostic types implemented across codebase

## Last Major Work
**Current**: Real-time service status indicators system (Problem 1 ✅ Complete)
- ✅ Created ServiceStatusManager for centralized status management
- ✅ Built useServiceStatus hook for React integration
- ✅ Added ServiceStatusIndicator component with visual status badges
- ✅ Integrated status indicators into scrobble notification UI
- ✅ Added authentication change notifications for immediate status updates
- ✅ Implemented honest capability system (services only claim implemented features)
- ✅ AniList now shows truthful status ("Ready", "Not logged in") until features implemented

**Previous**: `60322c5` - Unified service authentication system

## Development Environment
- **Package manager**: pnpm
- **Testing**: `npm run check-all` for full validation
- **Multi-service test**: `npx tsx src/test-services.ts`
- **Services registered**: 2 services (Trakt priority 1, AniList priority 2)

## Ready for Next Work
The codebase is in a clean, stable state ready for Phase 3 UI/UX multi-service integration work. 

**TODO System**: Now uses problem-solving format to encourage creative solutions rather than task execution. See TODO.md for current problems to solve with success criteria and alternative approaches.

## Context Recovery Commands
```bash
