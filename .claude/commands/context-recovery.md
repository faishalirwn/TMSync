# Context Recovery Protocol

Execute the context recovery protocol from CLAUDE.md:

1. Read TODO.md for current phase and pending tasks
2. Read CURRENT_STATE.md for recent work and architecture status  
3. Read DESIGN_DECISIONS.md for product design rationale
4. Run `git log --oneline -5` to see recent commits
5. Check current git status with `git status`
6. Verify system health with `pnpm type-check`

Then identify current work state and next priorities based on the gathered context.
